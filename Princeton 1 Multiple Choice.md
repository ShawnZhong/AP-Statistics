# Question 10

  -  The type I error is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis
     when the null hypothesis is true.

# Question 13

 ![Types of Hypothesis Tests Right-tail test Ha is more probable Ha: p

 probable Two-tail test Ha: \# value ](./media/image476.png)

  -  The right-tailed test is used. So there is a 5 percent area in the
     rejection region in the right tail of the sampling distribution.
     If we construct a 90 percent confidence interval, then the upper
     confidence limit will match the critical value. If the test of
     hypothesis is rejected at a 5 percent level of significance, then
     the test statistic fell in the rejection region. In other words,
     the hypothesized value of mean did not belong to the 90 percent
     confidence interval.

# Question 18

  -  A binomial model counts the number of successes out a fixed number
     of attempts at a task when each attempt has a constant probability
     of success

 ![P (X = c) = binompdf(n,p, c) n -\> number of trials p -\>
 probability of success This finds the probability of exactly c
 successes, for some number c. ](./media/image119.png)
 
 ![P (X c) = binomcdf(n, p, c) n -\> number of trials p -\> probability
 of success This finds the probability of c or fewer successes.

# Question 25

  -  The population of interest is the population you are trying to
     draw an inference about from the collected data sets.

# Question 31

  -  Response variable is about each sample, not the whole samples

 ![Some examples of responding variables in different
 experiments—things to be observed or measured are: The amount of
 water absorbed by two different brands of paper towels. How far a ball
 rolls from different ramp angles. The amount of feed eaten at a bird
 feeder in response to the type of seed in the feeder.

  -  Notice the difference between sample mean and sample proportion

 Statisti p(l — p) ](./media/image479.png)

# Question 37

  -  Equality of standard deviations is not necessary for a t-test to
     be valid. One of the conditions of a t-test is that the underlying
     populations must be normally distributed.
