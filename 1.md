      - > 30th percentile is the value **below which** 30 percent of the
        > observations may be found
    
      - > Take the average if there are two values

  - > Quartiles
    
      - > Q1 = first quartile = 25th percentile
    
      - > Q2 = median = 50 th percentile
    
      - > Q3 = third quartile = 75th percentile

# Measuring Spread

3.2 - Planning & Conducting Experiments

# Experiments vs. Observational Studies

  - > Ovservational Study
    
      - > Observe individuals
    
      - > Measure variables
    
      - > **Do NOT influence the response**
        
          - > Has global warming effected penguin mating behavior

  - > Experiment
    
      - > **Do something** to your individuals
    
      - > Observe/measure response
        
          - > Does housing penguins in warmer environments effect mating
            > behavior?

# Placebo Effect

  - > The phenomenon where **patients get better** because they
    > **expect** the treatment to work.

  - > Many statistical studies involve testing the effectiveness of
    > drugs. A placebo looks identical to the actual drug but contains
    > no active ingredient and so has no real physical effect.

  - > Humans want to be helped by the medication that is administered to
    > them. If they think they are receiving a drug to help their
    > condition, they tend to improve even if it turns out that the drug
    > is a placebo.

# Characteristics of a Well-Designed and Well-Conducted Experiment

  - > Control
    
      - > The effect of **lurking variables**, most often by comparing
        > treatments
    
      - > Example: a "Control group" in a drug study to eliminate the
        > "confounding effects" of environment or the placebo effect

  - > Replicate
    
      - > Each treatment on many units to **reduce chance variation**
    
      - > Example: do the mouse study many times

  - > Randomize
    
      - > Use probability (chance) to assign experimental units to
        > treatments
    
      - > May be the most **important**\!\!
    
      - > Because it allows us to say the different treatment groups
        > **start out similar**

# Completely Randomized Design

  - > If all the experimental units (subjects of the experiment) are
    > **randomly** assigned to either the **control group** or to the
    > **treatment group**, then the experiment has a completely
    > randomized design.

> ![Random Selection Subiects Treatment Group A Treatment Group B
> Compare Results Treatment Group C Control Group ](./media/image82.png)

  - > Randomize by assigning each subject a number and then generating
    > it to choose treatment groups

# Block Randomization

  - > Placing subjects into **groups of similar individuals**. The
    > random assignments into treatment groups is carried out separately
    > within each block (think stratified random sample)

> ![Random 300 Male Subjects 500 Subjects Female 200 Female Subiects

> Treatment Group A 50 Female Treatment Group B 50 Female Subjects
> Treatment Group C 50 Female Subiects Control Group 50 Female SubiectS
> Compare Results Compare Results ](./media/image83.png)

# Matched Pairs Design

  - > Subjects are **matched into pairs** and get **different
    > treatments**

  - > Matched pairs are **more similar** than random **unmatched
    > subjects**

  - > Randomizing the **rest of the experiment** is still
    > important\!\!\!

> ![( dc/ ](./media/image84.png)

# Experimental Set Up

  - > Treatment Imposed = Independent Variable = Factors

  - > Experimental Units = Subjects

> mouse dies mouse lives mouse dies variable' ](./media/image85.png)

# Double-Blind Experiment

> ![SINGLE BLIND Patients Con t Test Doctor ](./media/image86.png)
> 
> ![DOUBLE BLIND Patients Con t Test Doctor ](./media/image87.png)

  - > In a double-blind experiment, neither the subjects nor the
    > researchers know to which group, treatment, or control, subjects
    > have been assigned. If a researcher knows that a subject is in the
    > control group, they do not expect a treatment effect, and their
    > measurement of a response might be understated. If a researcher
    > knows that a subject is in the treatment group, they might
    > overstate a response simply because they expect it.

  - > An experiment might also be single-blind. In this case, only one
    > of the participants, either the subjects or the researchers, knows
    > to which group the subjects have been assigned.

  - > **Avoids unconscious bias**

# Generalizability of Results

  - > To determine if our data is "statically significant"
    
      - > i.e. is an observed effect so large that it would rarely occur

# Probability Model

  - > A mathematical description of a random phenomenon.

  - > The Probability Model consists of
    
      - > **Sample Space** (S) = the set of all possible outcomes
    
      - > **Event** within the sample space = an outcome or set of
        > outcomes in S
    
      - > **Probabilities** associated with each
> event

# Independence vs. Dependence

  - > A conditional probability is the probability of some event
    > occurring, given that some other event has already occurred. The
    > conditional probability of event X occurring, given that some
    > other event Y has already occurred, is written as P(X|Y).

  - > For example, P(M|N) would be the probability of the occurrence of
    > event M given that event N has already occurred. It would be read
    > as “the probability of M, given N.”

  - > As stated earlier, two events are considered independent if the
    > occurrence of one of the events does not change the probability of
    > the other event from what it would have been had the first event
    > not occurred. Thus, two events, X and Y, are independent if P(X|Y)
    > = P(X) or P(Y|X) = P(Y)

  - > Actually, these two conditional relationships are related. If one
    > is true, the other must be true. If one is false, the other must
    > be false.

  - > If **P(X|Y) = P(X)**, then **P(Y|X) = P(Y)**, and the events are
    > **independent**.

  - > If **P(X|Y) ≠ P(X),** then **P(Y|X) ≠ P(Y)**, and the events are
    > **dependent**.

# Hypothesis Test Example

When the manufacturing process is working properly, the batteries have
lifetimes that follow a right-skewed distribution with µ = 10 hours. A
quality control statistician selects a simple random sample of n = 20
batteries every hour and measures the lifetime of each.

If she is convinced that the mean lifetime of all batteries produced
that hour is less than 10 hours at the 5% significance level, then all
those batteries are discarded.

The current sample of 20 has a mean of 8.5 and a SD of 3, should this
batch be discarded?

  - > Hypothesis
    
      - > H0: µ = 10

# Question 2

> jurors are women. A particular trial requires that, out of a jury of
> 12, at least three are women. If a jury of 12 is to be selected at

> requirements of this trial? (A) (B) (C) (E) 0.168 0.843 0.915 The
> answer cannot be determined without know- ing the size of the jury
> pool. ](./media/image480.png)

    > of drawing a woman for the pool is nearly constant.

  - > However, since we are drawing 12 jurors without replacement, this
    > is not necessarily true unless the jury pool is very large (at
    > least 120)

# Question 30

> ![In a clinical trial, 30 sickle cell anemia patients are randomly
> assigned to two groups. One group receives the currently mar- keted
> medicine, and the other group receives an experimental medicine. Each

  - > This experiment consists of two treatments, the currently marketed
    > medicine and the experimental medicine. Patients are not matched,
    > and no blocks are formed. Only patients with sickle cell disease
    > are involved in the experiment.

# Question 31

  - > Confidence intervals are constructed as Statistic ± Margin of
    > Error.

  - > Therefore, the statistic is always right in the center of the
