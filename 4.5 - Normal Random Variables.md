# Practice Questions

1.   A study of college freshmen's study habits found that the time (in
     hours) that college freshmen use to study each week follows a
     normal distribution with a mean of 7.2 hours and a standard
     deviation of 5.3 hours

<!-- end list -->

  -  How many hours do the students who study in the top 15% spend
     studying?

  -  The middle 68%?
    
      -  Top 15%: 12.5 hours
    
      -  Middle 68%: 1.9 hours to 12.5 hours

1.   Suppose that the weight of navel oranges is normally distributed
     with mean of 8 ounces, and standard deviation of 1.3 ounces. And
     the weights of Valencia oranges is normally distributed with mean
     of 9 ounces, and standard deviation of 1.6 ounces

<!-- end list -->

  -  You grow a navel orange that weighs 9.5 ounces and a Valencia
     orange that weight 10.5 ounces, which should you enter in the
     giant fruit
 contest?

  -  Z score for navel orange = (9.5-8)/1.3 = 1.1538

  -  Z score for Valencia orange = (10.5-9)/1.6 = 0.9375

  -  The weights of newborn children in the United States vary
     according to the Normal Distribution with mean 7.5 pounds and
     standard deviation 1.25 pounds.

  -  What is the probability that a baby chosen at random weighs less
     than 5.5 pounds at birth?
