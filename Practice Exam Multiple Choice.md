 ![Type I error, also known as a "false positive": the error of
 rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually frue. In other words,
 this is the error of accepting an alternative hypothesis (the real
 hypothesis of interest) when the results can be attributed to chance.
 Plainly speaking, it occurs when we are observing a difference when in
 truth there is none (or more specifically - no statistically
 significant difference). So the probability of making a type I error
 in a test with rejection region R is P(R I Ho is true) . Type Il
 error, also known as a "false negative": the error of not rejecting a
 null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is the true state of
 nature. In other words, this is the error of failing to accept an
 alternative hypothesis when you don't have adequate power. Plainly
 speaking, it occurs when we are failing to observe a difference when
 in truth there is one. So the probability of making a type Il error in
 a test with rejection region R is 1 — P(R I Ha is true). The power of
 the test can be P(R IHa is true) . ](./media/image459.png)

# Question 15

 ![What Does 95% Confidence Mean Anyway? • A 95% confidence interval
 means that the method used to construct the interval will produce
 intervals containing the true p in about 95% of the intervals
 constructed. • This means that if the 95% Cl method was used in 100
 different samples, we would expect that about 95 of the intervals
 would contain the true p, and about 5 intervals would not contain the
 true p. Spo kane Virtual Learning Excellence for Everyone. Fv.wwher,

 ![One rainy Saturday morning, Adam woke up to hear his mom complaining
 about the house being dirty. "Mom is always grouchy when it rains,"
 Adam's brother said to him. So Adam decided to figure out if this
 statement was actually true- For the next year, he charted every time
 it rained and every time his mom was grouchy. What he found was very
 interesting - rainy days and his mom being grouchy were entirely
 independent events\_ Some of his data are shown in the table below.

 ![In engineering, science, and statistics, replication is the
 repetition of an experimental condition so that the variability
 associated with the phenomenon can be estimated. ASTM, in standard
 E1847, defines replication as "the repetition of the set of all the
 treatment combinations to be compared in an experiment. Replication
