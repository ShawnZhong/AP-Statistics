# Sampling Distribution

  -  The "sampling distribution" is the values taken by the statistic
     in all possible samples of the same size from that population

  -  The "sampling distribution" is always referring to the
     distribution of the sample

 distribution of a statistic across an infinite number of samples

# Central Limit Theorem

  -  The sampling distribution of the sample mean is normally
     distributed
