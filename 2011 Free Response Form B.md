# Question 1 (a)

  -  Estimation for median

 ![The median is the value with half of the P-T ratios at or below it
 and half of the values at or above it. to find the position of the
 median in the ordered list of For n observations in a group, use 2
 observations. For states west of the Mississippi (n = 24) the median
 falls between the 12th and 13th value in the ordered list, and both
 the 12th and 13th values fall in the interval 15—16. For states east
 of the Mississippi (n = 26) the median falls between the 13th and 14th
 value in the ordered list, and both of these values also fall in the
 interval 15—16. From the histogram, cumulative frequencies for the two
 groups are shown in the table below. Interval 12-13 13-14 14-15 15-16
 West 1 1+4=5 1 4 + 6 = 11 1 6 = 14 East 2+4=6 10 2 11 = 21 Thus, the
 median P-T ratio for both groups is at least 15 students per teacher
 and at most 16 students per teacher. ](./media/image343.png)

# Question 1 (c)

 ![The medians of the two distributions are about the same, as
 determined in part (a). The distribution of P-T ratios for states that
 are west of the Mississippi River is skewed to the riqht, indicating
 that the mean will probably be higher than the median. The rough for
 the east group indicates that the mean will be close to the median.
 Thus, the mean for the west group will probably be greater than the
 mean for the east group. ](./media/image344.png)

# Question 3 (a)

  -  Pay attention to the notation

 ![Let Y denote the number of flights Sam must make until he receives
 his first upgrade. The random variable Y follows a geometric
 distribution with p = 0.1. The probability that Sam's upgrade will
 occur after his third flight is calculated below. P(Y24) < 3) =0.729

# Question 3 (b)

 ![Let p denote the probability that Sam will be upgraded to first
 class on a particular flight. Let X denote the number of upgrades Sam
 will receive in 20 flights. The random variable X follows a binomial
 distribution with n = 20 independent trials and p = 0 1. The
 probability that Sam will be upgraded exactly 2 times in his next 20
 flights is calculated as follows. 20 18) 2 = 0 2852

# Question 3 (c)

 ![Let X denote the number of upgrades Sam will receive in 104 flights.
 The random variable X follows a binomial distribution with n = 104
 independent trials and p = 0.1. Thus, p (x \> 20) = I-P(X 20)
 -1-0.9986 0.0014. Because this probability is so small, it is very
 unlikely that Sam would receive more than 20 upgrades in 104 flights
 if the airline's claim is correct. This would be expected to happen
 less than 1 percent of the time, indicating that one should be
 surprised if Sam receives more than 20 upgrades during the next year.

# Question 4 (b)

  -  Conditions for a chi-square inference procedure

 ![The following conditions for inference are met: 1. The students were
 randomly selected. 2. The expected cell counts should be at least 5.
 The computer output indicates that all expected counts are greater
 than 5. The smallest expected cell count is 6.825.

# Question 4 (d)

 ![Because the null hypothesis was rejected a Type I error may have
 been made. A Type I error is concluding that there is an association
 between the perceived effect of part-time work on academic achievement
 and the average time spent on part-time jobs when, in reality, there
 is no association between the two variables. ](./media/image351.png)

  -  Interpretation for one-proportion Z interval

 ![Based on the sample, we are 99 percent confident that the proportion
 of the vaccine-eligible people in the United States who actually got
 vaccinated is between 0.39 and 0.44. Because 0.45 is not in the 99
 percent confidence interval, it is for the population proportion of
 vaccine-eligible people who received the vaccine. In other words, the
 confidence interval is inconsistent with the belief that 45 percent of
 those eligible got vaccinated. ](./media/image356.png)

# Question 5 (b)

 ![The sample-size calculation uses 0.5 as the value of the proportion
 in order to provide the minimum required sample size to guarantee that
 the resulting interval will have a margin of error no larger than
 0.02. (0.02)2 2 2 576 2(0.02) = 4,147.36 Thus, a sample of at least 4,
 148 vaccine-eligible people should be taken in Canada.

# Question 6 (c)

  -  Describe distribution: Mean & Standard deviation

 ![Because the distribution of nitrogen removed for any particular
 buffer strip width is normally distributed with a standard deviation
 of 5 parts per hundred, the sampling distribution of the mean of four
 observations when the buffer strips are 6 feet wide will be normal
 with mean 33.8+3.6 X 6 = 55.4 = = 2.5 parts per hundred. parts per

# Question 6 (d)

 ![The distribution of the sample mean is normal, so the interval that
 has probability 0.95 of containing the mean nitrogen content removed
 from four buffer strips of width 6 feet extends from 55.4—1.96 x 2.5 =
 50.5 parts per hundred to 55.4 + 1.96x2.5 = 60.3 parts per hundred.

 (feet) If we think that the sample mean nitrogen removed at a
 particular buffer width might reasonably be a sample regression line
 will result from connecting any point in the interval above 6 to any
 point in the interval above 13. With this in mind, the dashed lines in
 the plots above represent extreme cases for possible sample reqression
 lines. From these plots, we can see that there is a wider range of
 possible slopes in the second plot (on the right) than in the first
 plot (on the left). Because of this, in the sampling distribution of
 b, the estimator for the slope of the regression line, will be smaller
 for the first studv Dlan (with four observations at 6 feet and four
 observations at 13 feet) than it would be for the second study plan
 (with four observations at 8 feet and four observations at 10 feet).
 Therefore, the first study plan (on the left) would provide a better
 estimator of the slope of the regression line than the second study
 plan (on the right). ](./media/image366.png)

# Question 6 (f)

 ![To assess the linear relationship between width of the buffer strip
 and the amount of nitrogen removed from runoff water, more widths
 should be used. To detect a nonlinear relationship it would be best to
 use buffer widths that were spaced out over the entire range of
 interest. For example, if the range of interest is 6 to 13 feet, eight
 buffers with widths 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 feet could be used.
