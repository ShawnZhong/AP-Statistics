# Question 13

  -  Standard deviation of the sample distribution

 ![MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF cont. Standard Deviation of the
 Sampling Distribution of X The standard deviation of the sam lin
 distribution of x is n where o is the standard deviation of the
 population and n is the sample size. This formula is used when n /N
 .05, where N is the population size. 23 ](./media/image425.png)

# Question 23

 ![In statistical hypothesis testing, a type I error is the incorrect
 rejection of a true null hypothesis (a "false positive"), while a type
 Il error is incorrectly retaining a false null hypothesis (a "false
 negative"). Type I and type Il errors - Wikipedia
