# Practice Questions for Binomial Distribution

  -  A manufacturer produces a large number of toasters. From past
     experience, the manufacturer knows that approximately 4% are
     defective. In a quality control procedure, we randomly select 40
     toasters for testing.
    
      -  Determine the probability that exactly one of the toasters is
         defective

 ![PIX= D ](./media/image121.png)

  -  Find the probability that at most two of the toasters are
     defective

# Practice Questions for Geometric Distribution

  -  There is a probability of 0.09 that a vaccine will cause a certain
     side effect. Suppose that a number of patients are inoculated with
     the vaccine. We are interested in the number of patients
     vaccinated until the first side effect is observed
    
      -  Find the probability that exactly 4 patients must be
         vaccinated in order to observe the first side effect.
