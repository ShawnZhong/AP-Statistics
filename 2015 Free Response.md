# Question 1 (b)

 ![Corporation A Corporation B $30 $40 $50 $60 $70 $80 Yearly Salary
 (thousands) ](./media/image437.png)
 
 ![(i) Five years after starting, at least 3 out of 30 (10%) of the
 salaries at Corporation A are greater than the maximum salary at
 Corporation B. If I accept the offer from Corporation A, I might be
 able to at Corporation A than at Corporation B. (ii) Five years after
 starting, the minimum salary at Corporation B is greater than at
 Corporation A. In fact, at Corporation A it looks like some people are
 still making the starting salary of $36,000 and never received a raise
 in the five years since they were hired. So if I work at Corporation
 A, I might never receive a raise in salary. ](./media/image438.png)

# Question 4

 ![Step 1: States a correct pair of hypotheses. Let pasp represent the
 population proportion of adults similar to those in the study who
 would have developed colon cancer within the six years of the study if
 they had taken a low-dose aspirin each day. Similarly, let pplac
 represent the population proportion of adults similar to those in the
 study who would have developed colon cancer within the six years of
 the study if they had taken a placebo each day. The hypotheses to be
 tested are Ho : pasp pplac versus Ha : pasp \< pplac or equivalently,
 Ho : pasp O versus H : p a asp — Pplac \< O. — Pplac Step 2:
 Identifies a correct test procedure (by name or by formula) and checks
 appropriate conditions. The appropriate procedure is a two-sample
 z-test for comparing proportions. Because this is a randomized
 experiment, the first condition is that the volunteers were randomly
 assigned to one treatment group or the other. The condition is
 satisfied because we are told that the volunteers were randomly
 assigned to take a low-dose aspirin or a placebo. The second condition
 is that the sample sizes are large, relative to the proportions
 involved. The condition is satisfied because all sample counts are
 large enough; that is, 15 with colon cancer in aspirin group, 26 with
 colon cancer in placebo group, 500 — 15 = 485 cancer-free in aspirin
 group, and 500 — 26 = 474 cancer-free in placebo group.

 ![Step 3: Calculates the appropriate test statistic and p-value. — =
 0.030 and The sample proportions who developed colon cancer are p asp
 — 500 15 + 26 The combined sample proportion who developed colon
 cancer is pcombined — 26 = 0.052. - 500 = 0.041. The test statistic is
 z — stribution. 0.030 - 0.052 0.041(1 - 0.041) A + 500 500 + 500 —1.75
 (—1.7542 from calculator). 1 500 The p-value is P(Z —1.75) = 0.0401
 (0.0397 from calculator), where Z has a standard no

 ![Step 4: States a correct conclusion in the context of the study,
 using the result of the statistical test. Because the p-value is less
 than the given significance level of a = 0.05, we reject the null
 hypothesis. The data provide convincing statistical evidence that the
 proportion of all adults similar to the volunteers who would develop
 colon cancer if they had taken a low-dose aspirin every day is less
 than the proportion of all adults similar to the volunteers who would
 develop colon cancer if they had not taken a low-dose aspirin every
 day. ](./media/image441.png)

# Question 5 (a)

  -  Response should be given in context

 ![There is a moderately strong, positive, linear relationship between
 height and arm span so that taller students tend to have lonqer arm
 spans. ](./media/image442.png)

# Question 6 (c)

 ![Method 2 would result in less variability in the sample of 200
 tortillas on a given day because the sample comes from only one
 production line. Because the distributions of diameters are not the
 same for the two production lines, selecting tortillas from both lines
 as in Method 1 would result in more variable sample data.
